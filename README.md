# Zenless-Pull-Simulator
A quick and albeit simple simulator for Zenless Zone Zero's gacha mechanics. Can be adapted for other gacha games as well. Keeps track of pity and guarantees AND also plays the in-game music (conditional for S-ranks as well). May rarely display weird things. Very inefficient and spaghetti, but hey - it works!

Note: Playing music requires sound files found in the "resources" folder. Using the URL will not have sound.
